<p>Seitan is a nutritious, high-protein meat substitute which originates in China. It was possibly invented by vegetarian Buddhist monks. Use it to &lsquo;veganise&rsquo; your favourite meat recipes, including curry, stew, burgers, sausages, roasts and even steak. It has the same chewy texture as meat and can take on any flavour you add during the cooking process. I&rsquo;m going to start with the ingredients and a couple of core recipes then suggest a couple of other types you can try.</p>
<h1>Oven-baked seitan</h1>
<h2>Basic ingredients for four servings</h2>
<p>2 cups vital wheat gluten</p>
<p>1 cup nutritional yeast</p>
<p>2 cups cold water</p>
<p>2 tbs soy sauce or liquid amino</p>
<p>2 tsp vegan bouillon (or combine onion and garlic powder)</p>
<p>1/3 cup vegetable oil</p>
<h3>Extra flavour</h3>
<p>1 tbs liquid smoke</p>
<p>1 tsp cumin</p>
<p>1 tsp smoked paprika</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Mix up the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, soy sauce and bouillon, as well as any ingredients you add for extra flavour. You will end up with a soggy ball of dough.</p>
<p>Form the dough into a loaf. Grease the silver foil with the vegetable oil and wrap the loaf up in it. Bake the loaf in an oven for 30 minutes. Remove the silver foil taking care not to leave any foil stuck to the outside. Bake it for another 20 minutes to give it a crispy coating.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<ul>
<li>serve up the seitan as a roast by just cutting it into slices.</li>
<li>fry it in oil like steak or bacon &ndash; try rubbing in black pepper and salt first.</li>
<li>chop it into cubes to serve it in stirf-fry</li>
<li>grind it up in a food processor to make mince</li>
</ul>
<h1>Variations</h1>
<p>Seitan is very versatile and absorbs any flavour you like. You can recreate virtually any traditional meat recipe with vegan ingredients.</p>
<p>When you form the vital wheat gluten into dough you can sprinkle on your own coating and bake it as usual: Cajun seasoning is a good way to start. I make my most-popular seitan recipe by rolling the dough in half a cup of crushed peppercorns &ndash; use a combination of red, green, white and black. I tend to err on the side of spicy if I&rsquo;m experimenting.</p>
<p>Combining the vital wheat gluten with another grain or legume alters the texture. Mixing it with a cup of cooked lentils or quinoa. gives it a rougher, grainier feel which reminds me of meatloaf. Cook the legumes in advance then add it to the vital what gluten with the other ingredients at the very start.</p>
<h1>Seitan cooked in broth</h1>
<h2>Basic ingredients for four servings</h2>
<p>2 cups vital wheat gluten</p>
<p>1 cup nutritional yeast</p>
<p>1 cup boiling water</p>
<p>2 tbs soy sauce or liquid amino</p>
<p>2 tsp vegan bouillon (or combine onion and garlic powder)</p>
<p>Vegetable stock</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Mix up the dry ingredients with the soy sauce then add the boiling water a bit at a time, stirring it with a spoon to form a lump of dough. Add enough water until the dough has picked up all the vital wheat gluten. Knead this for about a minute or so until you&rsquo;ve got a stretchy ball which is slightly sticky on the outside.</p>
<p>Prepare a pan of around six cups of boiling vegetable stock. I just use more bouillon for this. Using a chopping board, slice the seitan into pieces. You can chop it as small as you like. If you want steaks, chop it in into four and squash the pieces slightly with your hand. If you&rsquo;re cooking stew, chop the ball into 32 small pieces.</p>
<p>Simmer the seitan pieces in the vegetable stock for around 40 minutes and your seitan is ready to serve.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Oven-baked seitan is like a stretchy loaf which can be sliced. The variety cooked in broth comes out of the pan more like a piece of meat. If you&rsquo;re going to serve the seitan straight after it&rsquo;s cooked I&rsquo;d go for the broth-based version.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Your seitan will come out of the pan ready to eat but there are plenty more things you can do with it: fry it up like a steak with seasoning, barbecue it with vegetables, marinade it, sitr fry it &hellip; go mental. It absorbs just about any flavour.</p>
<p>For former meat eaters: try adding cumin to make the seitan more like dark meat. For more of a chicken flavour, flavour it with white miso. For bacon use 1 tsp smoked paprika and 1 tbs liquid smoke.</p>
<p>Try adding more ingredients as it boils in the stock: if you add vegetables and rice you have a stew.</p>
<p>Southern-style seitan with a breadcrumb coating is a wonderful variation although it took me a few times to make it work &ndash; same with seitan in general.</p>
<h2>Glazed Gammun</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Oven baked seitan</p>
<h3>Glaze:</h3>
<p>1 tbs marmalade</p>
<p>1 tbs English mustard</p>
<p>1tbs brown sugar</p>
<p>&frac12; cup water</p>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Put the seitan in the oven to bake for half an hour while you prepare the glaze.</p>
<p>Mix the glaze together in a bowl.</p>
<p>After you bake the setian for half an hour remove the silver foil then spread the glaze around the outside and put it back in the oven for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Beware: the glaze can make the temperature drop so if you&rsquo;re not careful, the middle won&rsquo;t be cooked properly. If you find the outside of the gammun is cooked but it&rsquo;s soggy in the middle, you can rescue it by slicing it then frying the slices in oil to make sure the middle is cooked.</p>
