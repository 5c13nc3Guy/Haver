<b>Prerequisites for repository transfers:</b>

When you transfer a repository that you own to another user account, the new owner will receive a confirmation email. The confirmation email includes instructions for accepting the transfer. If the new owner doesn't accept the transfer within one day, the invitation will expire.
To transfer a repository that you own to an organization, you must have permission to create a repository in the target organization.
The target account must not have a repository with the same name, or a fork in the same network.
The original owner of the repository is added as a collaborator on the transferred repository. Other collaborators to the transferred repository remain intact.
Private forks can't be transferred.
